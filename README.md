# single_stage_pose_estimation
This is an unofficial implementation of [Single-Stage Multi-Person Pose Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09220).
The backend model is [Soft-gated Skip Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11098v1)

TODO
- [x] training
- [x] load MSCOCO keypoint dataset
- [ ] calculate accuracy(oks)
- [ ] mobile
- [ ] multi-gpu training
- [ ] introduce [DarkPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06278)
